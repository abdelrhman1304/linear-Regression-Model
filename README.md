# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

This project implements a simple linear regression model from scratch using gradient descent. It is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of linear regression, including the cost function, gradient computation, and parameter optimization. The notebook also includes comprehensive visualizations to illustrate the model's training process and performance.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model that predicts a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. The model is trained using gradient descent to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual values. In addition to the model implementation, the project provides visualizations to help understand:

- **Training Data Visualization:** A scatter plot of the training data alongside the fitted regression line.
- **Cost Function Convergence:** A plot showing how the cost (MSE) decreases over iterations.
- **Parameter Updates:** Plots tracking the evolution of model parameters (w and b) over iterations.

## Features

- **Custom Cost Function:** Implements the mean squared error (MSE) cost function.
- **Gradient Computation:** Calculates gradients for model parameters to optimize using gradient descent.
- **Parameter Optimization:** Utilizes gradient descent to iteratively update parameters.
- **Comprehensive Visualizations:** Includes multiple plots to illustrate training data, regression line, cost convergence, and parameter evolution.
- **Modular Code:** Clearly structured code with detailed inline comments and metadata for each code cell.


# Usage

## Open the Notebook:
Open the `linear_Regression_Model.ipynb` file in your preferred Jupyter environment (Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VSCode).

## Run the Notebook:
Execute the cells sequentially to:
- Import necessary libraries.
- Load and preprocess the data.
- Define the cost function, gradient computation, and gradient descent functions.
- Train the linear regression model using gradient descent.
- Visualize the training data, regression line, cost function convergence, and parameter updates.

## Review the Outputs:
The notebook will print the optimized parameters and display multiple plots illustrating the training process and performance of the model.
